    "A Large Language Model, as you know, is a form of machine learning model capable of performing various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, text classification, conversational question answering, and language translation.<br>
 
    
    <br>
    
   The term "large" pertains to the substantial number of values (parameters) that the language model can autonomously adjust as it learns. Some of the most successful LLMs boast billions of parameters.
    
    Moving on.<br>
    
    <br>
    
    launched in Nov 2022 by OpenAI as quickly become the golden child of artificial intelligence. Used by millions, the AI chatbot is able to answer questions, tell stories, write web code, and even conceptualize incredibly complicated topics.<br>
    
    <br>
    
    It remains hugely popular and equally controversial.<br>
    
    <br>
    
    This issue of AnnoVelocity examines some of the most innovative use cases, both in LLMs and ChatGPT.<br>
    <br>

        "Do LLMs stop at powering advanced chatbots and virtual assistants that engage in natural and meaningful conversations with users.<br>
        
        <br>
        
        Truth is LLMs go far beyond this<br>
        
        <br>
        
        From unravelling the intricate patterns in genetic sequences to automating programming tasks, LLMs demonstrate their versatility by adapting to specialized challenges and delivering remarkable outcomes.<br>
        
        <br>
        
        For tasks involving creativity, Large Language Models (LLMs) have predominantly been employed in the generation of stories and scripts. In the context of generating long-form stories there is a specialized LLM named. Dramatron., an interactive co-authorship script writing tool which leverages large language models such as Chinchilla. It uses hierarchical generation and prompt chaining to ensure long range consistency across the entire script. As input, the user provides a log line, and from this single log line the system can generate an entire script with characters, plot, settings, and dialogue.<br>
        
        <br>
        
        With a capacity of 70 billion parameters, this LLM employs techniques like prompting, prompt chaining, and hierarchical generation to create complete scripts and screenplays autonomously. Dramatron's effectiveness was qualitatively assessed through co-writing and interviews with industry experts and it scored well.<br>
        <br>
        Hollywood's writers have reasons to worry.

        Chinchilla is a family of Large Language Models developed by DeepMind which is now a Google company.<br>

    
    <br>
    
    One estimates the world's total stock of usable text data is between 4.6 trillion and 17.2 trillion tokens. This includes all the world’s books, all scientific papers, all news articles, all of Wikipedia, all publicly available code, and much of the rest of the internet, filtered for quality (e.g., webpages, blogs, social media). Another recent estimate puts the total figure at 3.2 trillion tokens.<br>
    
    <br>
    
    Chinchilla, one of today's leading LLMs, was trained on 1.4 trillion tokens and is known for its superior performance<br>

        Milo's founder, Avni Patel Thompson almost shut down the company before reaching out to Sam Altman.<br>

    
    <br>
    
    The dream was to create a virtual secretary, or "co-pilot," that could clear her of all of the mental static that comes with parenting, like daily reminders to sign permission slips, for birthday party invites or doctor's appointments, without the heavy lift of making spreadsheets and calendars on top of her demanding job.<br>
    
    <br>
    
    Thompson named her startup Milo, an acronym for "my important loved ones," and raised some early funding from the accelerator Y Combinator in 2020. But each iteration of the product kept glitching and her funding was drying up.<br>
    
    <br>
    
    Her Hail Mary pass was to reach out to Sam Altman the OpenAI CEO and former Y Combinator head with whom she had connected with during her time there. She had followed his work with large language models like GPT-4 and asked him if this was the missing piece that could make Milo work. He quickly responded and told her she was on the right track, and put her in touch with his team.<br>
    
    <br>
    
    Milo is into Beta now.The company's first real test will come in the following weeks with back-to-school season, said Thompson, but she wants to make sure all of the bugs are ironed out before she opens it to the general public.<br>

            This is from Forbes. A popular narrative these days is that ChatGPT and conversational LLMs like it are on the verge of replacing Google Search as the world's go-to source for information, disrupting the once-mighty tech giant like Blockbuster or Kodak were disrupted before it.<br>
    
        
        <br>
        
        This narrative badly oversimplifies things. LLMs as they exist today will never replace Google Search. Why not? In short, because today's LLMs make stuff up. Will this scenario change, it's too early to tell.<br>
